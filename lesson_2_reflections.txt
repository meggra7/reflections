What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a hidden .git file in the directory.  This is necessary so that Git has a
file to track the commits and changes that are made.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle ground between the working directory and the repository.  The staging area contains
only the part of the working directory that you wish to commit.  It is different from the repository in that these
files are not actually part of the repository - yet - but rather are the files that want to put in the repository.
This is valuable in that it gives you a chance to play around with files and changes prior to actually committing
them in the repository.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

It is a good idea to review the changes between the working directory, the staging area, and the commit log to make
sure you are committing a single logical change at a time.  Even if you have multiple changes you want to commit, you
can use the staging area to add a single change and commit, then continue adding any additional changes from the
working directory to the staging area and committing again, as needed.
