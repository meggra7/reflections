What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a hidden .git file in the directory.  This is necessary so that Git has a
file to track the commits and changes that are made.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle ground between the working directory and the repository.  The staging area contains
only the part of the working directory that you wish to commit.  It is different from the repository in that these
files are not actually part of the repository - yet - but rather are the files that want to put in the repository.
This is valuable in that it gives you a chance to play around with files and changes prior to actually committing
them in the repository.
