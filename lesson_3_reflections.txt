When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be helpful if you are working on a project with others working on separate computers, or if
you will be working from different locations such as a work computer, home computer, and/or laptop.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

If you are working on a feature independently, you will likely only want to push and/or pull commits once you are
satisfied with your work.  If you pull commits from others before you are done you may pull code that you aren't
ready to compile with yours.  In the same manner you most likely won't want to push commits for your work until they
are at a workable state.
